# arrayMode
Given array of integers, find its mode.

Example

For sequence = [1, 3, 3, 3, 1], the output should be

arrayMode(sequence) = 3;
For sequence = [1, 3, 2, 1], the output should be

arrayMode(sequence) = 1.
Input/Output

[time limit] 500ms (cpp)
[input] array.integer sequence

An unsorted array of integers.

Constraints:

3 ≤ sequence.length ≤ 5 · 104,

1 ≤ sequence[i] ≤ 1000.

[output] integer

The mode of sequence. It is guaranteed that there is an unambiguous answer for the given data.
